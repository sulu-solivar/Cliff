    Drag-and-Drop the following quotations so that they are in order from those that have the highest value in your own life to those that have the least value.  The word or phrase that you agree with the most—that is, the one that has the highest value in your own life—should be in the first position. The one that you disagree with the most—that is, which has the least value in your own life—should be in the last position.
